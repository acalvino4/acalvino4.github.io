## Augustine's Portfolio website

I created this website simply to display for anyone interested who I am and what I can do, as well as for the fun a building a website.

Access the website [here](acalvino4.github.io).

### Takeaways
My biggest takeaway was learning how to make sense of someone else's code and modify it. (I started out feeling intimidated to modify anything other than HTML, but by the end was modifying the scss, color palette, and even javascript with ease.) I gained a lot of proficiency with Chrome DevTools, which was extremely helpful in locating elements, styles, and javascript that I wanted to modify.  I performed the process of modifying and compiling sass to css for the first time.
